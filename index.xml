      <description>When we work with computers, we deal with digital rather than analog circuits. They are electrical circuits that operate with two values: true and false, or yes and no.
Computers only work with those two values, usually referred to as bits. A bit is a single value that is either true or false.
We combine 8 bits into bytes and create combinations to solve a variety of problems. But how does that work?</description>

      <description>In the previous section, we have seen that we can use gates in a digital circuit to represent and answer more complex problems.
Logic in software When programming software, we will often have to deal with decisions on a logical level or even on a bit-level. To allow us to do that, all programming languages offer some kind of boolean logic operators.
  Recap: Boolean values   We have established that in digital logic, we work with two values.</description>
